## __Mirela's Secret Notes App__ ##

### ___Summary:___ ###  
__I've created a small application where you can sign up, login and store whatever "secret notes" you want to. They are going to be password protected, so well-kept. As log as you don't logout on purpose, the app will remember the last session and you'll stay in your account at runtime. Just give it a try. :relaxed:__
