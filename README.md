Mirela's Secret Notes App

Summary: I've created a small application where you can sign up, login and store whatever "secret notes" you want to. They are going to be password protected, so well-kept. Just give it a try.

Setup and installation:\
-> make sure you have installed the latest Python version\
-> git clone <repo-url>\
-> pip install requirements.txt

To run the app:\
-> run main.py

To view the app:\
-> go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
